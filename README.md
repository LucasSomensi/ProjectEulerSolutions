# ProjectEulerSolutions
Some solutions to ProjectEuler.net's mathematical problems. Written in Python, C++, Java and also Excel.

These solutions were all created by me (LucasSomensi) back when I was in college in 2012, so the repository only contains solutions to older problems.
Many of these solutions are not very well optimized, but all of them solved the problem within a reasonable timeframe in my old laptop.
Enjoy!
